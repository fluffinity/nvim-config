# My Neovim Config
This Neovim config is forked from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) to better suit my own needs.
Maybe it will stay mostly similar, maybe it will completely change over time.
I can't tell what will happen but maybe you will find my config useful for yourself.
If you want a less opinionated starting point for your own config I recommend directly using
the upstream repo instead or read the [upstream README](README_UPSTREAM.md).
